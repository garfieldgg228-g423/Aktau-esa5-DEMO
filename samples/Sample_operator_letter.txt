Subject: Re: Coordination plan proposal — SATELLITE MOON vs MIA-X01, CDM 9850145153

Hello MIA Operations,

Thanks for the quick acknowledgment.

Coordination proposal for CDM 9850145153:

We are not requesting that you maneuver at this stage.

We request you freeze non-essential maneuvers affecting trajectory through TCA, unless mission safety requires otherwise.

We will run additional screening and target a decision checkpoint on 2025-04-27 18:00 UTC, with a final update by 2025-04-28 18:00 UTC.

We do expect possible CDM updates before TCA. If you receive any newer CDM than 9850145153, please forward the CDM ID and creation_date, plus headline changes.

Please also confirm whether you have any mandatory station-keeping windows between now and TCA.

Regards,
Operator A - LUNASAT
