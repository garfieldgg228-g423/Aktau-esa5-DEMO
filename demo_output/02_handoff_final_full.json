Summary:

Thread scope covered: Coordination and decision-making on close approach event between SATELLITE MOON (LUNASAT) and MIA-X01 (MIA-CORPORATION) covering CDMs 9850145153, 9850145154, 9850145155 over 2025-04-25 to 2025-04-29 including maneuver freeze, CDM updates, and final avoidance burn

Operator transitions (if any): No operator change within thread; Operator A (LUNASAT) and Operator B (MIA-CORPORATION) consistent throughout

Messages exchanged (кратко по хронологии):

LUNASAT (25 Apr) alerted MIA-CORP on predicted close approach (CDM 9850145153), requesting maneuver intent and freeze confirmation
MIA-CORP confirmed maneuverability but no avoidance decision yet, requested clarification on which party maneuvers and timing details
LUNASAT proposed freeze on non-essential maneuvers, planned internal screening checkpoints, requested station-keeping windows info
MIA-CORP agreed to freeze barring mission-critical exceptions, noted non-mandatory routine station-keeping, queried OD updates and preferred avoidance direction
LUNASAT provided new CDM 9850145154, noted lower Pc but some inconsistencies in screen timing, requested freeze confirmation
MIA-CORP acknowledged CDM, confirmed freeze active, raised questions on further updates and avoidance direction if needed
LUNASAT scheduled additional screening, gave preferred avoidance direction (cross track positive), advised readiness for possible maneuver request by 29 Apr 20:30 UTC
MIA-CORP maintained freeze confirmation, suggested querying CDM originator on timing inconsistency, requested decision checkpoint reconfirmation
LUNASAT issued update with CDM 9850145155 showing Pc increase crossing threshold, requested freeze and maneuver acceptance conditions, cutoff times
MIA-CORP acknowledged CDM, confirmed freeze, prepared to perform avoidance burn if LUNASAT remains non-maneuvering, requested final LUNASAT intent by 29 Apr 20:30 UTC
LUNASAT confirmed no planned maneuver, requested MIA perform avoidance burn, confirmed preferred direction and cutoff times
MIA-CORP executed avoidance burn at 29 Apr 21:12 UTC, reported nominal parameters and transmitted updated ephemeris
LUNASAT confirmed post-TCA event closure, recorded decision and actions, archived updated ephemeris
CDMs referenced/updated: CDM 9850145153, 9850145154, 9850145155 all referenced and monitored through thread; progressive updates with changes in collision probability and TCA noted

New CDMs detected: CDM 9850145154 and 9850145155 received and incorporated after initial CDM 9850145153

Operational status (ours vs counterpart): LUNASAT did not execute avoidance maneuver but monitored risk; MIA-CORPORATION maintained freeze then executed avoidance burn as per coordination

Planned actions: Final ephemeris distributed and archived; continued readiness for event screening and maneuver planning per future CDMs and coordination

Pending expectations / monitoring items: No unresolved items; event closed post TCA with full handoff records retained
